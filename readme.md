# Human Protein Classification
---
This was a private competition held on Kaggle as a part of *Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs* course held by freecodecamp and Jovian.ml. <br>
My classifier ranked me in the top 20% of the competition where I used resnet and densenet models. <br><br>
More about the competition and data can be seen [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jovian-pytorch-z2g/overview).
